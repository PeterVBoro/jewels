## About
This is an attempt to make a clone of the popular 'jewels' game. This idea came to me
when I was playing World of Warcraft's recent expansion, where one of the minigames is
a jewels clone as well, and while playing it I thought "I could do that," so here we
are. There is no sound at the moment and the animations are iffy. I did not use any
gaming libraries as I wanted to see what I can do with just React and CSS.
